## Project details

### Problem Statement:

Many individuals and teams face challenges in efficiently managing tasks and projects, resulting in missed deadlines and decreased productivity. There is a clear need for a robust task management solution to enhance organization and streamline workflow processes.

### Project Idea:

Develop a task management application using the PERN stack (PostgreSql, Express.js, React, Node.js). The application will empower users to create, organize, prioritize, and track tasks seamlessly within a collaborative environment.

### Project Components:

* Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) Operations:
    * Enable users to create new tasks with details such as title, description, due date, priority, and assigned user.
    * Implement functionality for users to view, edit, and delete tasks as needed for effective task management.

* Task Filtering and Sorting:
    * Provide options to filter tasks based on criteria such as status (e.g., open, in progress, completed), priority, and due date.
    * Allow sorting of tasks by various parameters such as due date, priority, and assigned user to facilitate organized task viewing.

* Collaboration:
    * Facilitate collaboration among team members by allowing task assignment and tracking of task progress.
    * Enable users to assign tasks to specific team members and track updates and completion status in real-time.

* Dashboard Analytics:
    * Create a comprehensive dashboard to present an overview of tasks, including total tasks, completed tasks, overdue tasks, and upcoming deadlines.
    * Generate basic analytics and reports to track team productivity and task completion rates, such as the number of tasks assigned, completed, and overdue per user.
